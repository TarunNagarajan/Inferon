# Inferon: 50-Day Detailed & Practical Project Roadmap
*A Sparse + Quantized Kernel Generator for High-Performance AI Inference*

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

Design and implement a production-ready toolchain that takes **ONNX operators** (GEMM, Conv) and emits **quantized, sparse-aware compute kernels** (in C++ with AVX2 intrinsics), optimized for **x86-64 desktop/server inference** with **PyTorch/ONNXRuntime integration**.

## 🌟 Core Philosophy & "Wow Factor"

This project's "wow factor" is its **pragmatic focus and technical depth**. It demonstrates elite, low-level engineering skill by building a tool that solves a real-world, high-impact problem: making inference faster on existing hardware. The focus is on **expert-level C++ craftsmanship**, not on building a complex compiler.

## 🗓️ Detailed Daily Breakdown

### 🔹 **Phase 1: Foundation & Sparse GEMM (Days 1–10)**

- **Day 1: Project Scaffolding**
  1.  **Goal:** Establish a clean, professional project structure.
  2.  Create the root directory and initialize a `git` repository to start version control immediately.
  3.  Lay out the subdirectory structure: `src/` for C++ source, `include/` for headers, `tests/` for test code, `examples/` for sample usage, and `benchmarks/` for performance tests.
  4.  Add a `.gitignore` file from a C++/CMake template to keep the repository clean of build artifacts.
  5.  Create an initial `README.md` file with a one-sentence description of the project.

- **Day 2: Build System & CI**
  1.  **Goal:** Create a robust build system and continuous integration pipeline.
  2.  Write the root `CMakeLists.txt` file. Define the project name, C++ standard (e.g., C++17), and basic compiler flags.
  3.  Integrate the Google Test framework using `FetchContent` in CMake for easy dependency management.
  4.  Set up a basic GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that triggers on push, checks out the code, configures CMake, and runs the tests.
  5.  Write a "hello world" test case to ensure the entire pipeline (CMake, GTest, CI) is working.

- **Day 3: Core C++ Interfaces**
  1.  **Goal:** Define the key architectural contracts for the system.
  2.  In `include/`, create `KernelEmitter.h`. Define an abstract base class `KernelEmitter` with a pure virtual method like `emit(const Operator& op)`. This defines *what* a kernel generator does.
  3.  Create `SparseFormat.h`. Define a `SparseFormat` base class. This will allow you to handle different sparse representations later.
  4.  Create `Quantization.h`. Define a `QuantizationScheme` base class to encapsulate different quantization strategies (per-tensor, per-channel).
  5.  These interfaces are critical for ensuring the components of your system are decoupled and testable from the start.

- **Day 4: Python Bindings & Packaging**
  1.  **Goal:** Make your C++ code callable from Python for easier testing and integration.
  2.  Integrate `pybind11` into your CMake build, again using `FetchContent`.
  3.  Create a `bindings.cpp` file in `src/` to house the pybind11 code.
  4.  Write a `setup.py` file that uses the `CMakeExtension` helper to make your project pip-installable (`pip install .`).
  5.  Expose a simple "hello world" C++ function to Python to verify the entire C++ -> Python binding process works.

- **Day 5: ONNX Parser**
  1.  **Goal:** Read an ONNX model to understand the work that needs to be done.
  2.  Add the ONNX C++ library as a dependency in CMake.
  3.  Write a C++ class `ONNXParser` that can take a file path to an `.onnx` model.
  4.  Implement a method to load the model and iterate through its graph nodes.
  5.  For now, just print the name and operator type (e.g., "MatMul", "Conv") of each node. This verifies you can read and access the basic graph structure.

- **Day 6: Sparse Format Implementation (CSR)**
  1.  **Goal:** Implement the most critical sparse data structure.
  2.  Create `CSRMatrix.h` and `.cpp` files, inheriting from `SparseFormat`.
  3.  Implement the CSR data structure: `values` (non-zero values), `col_indices` (column for each value), and `row_ptr` (start index for each row).
  4.  Write a C++ function to convert a dense `std::vector<std::vector<float>>` into your `CSRMatrix` representation.
  5.  Write extensive unit tests for the conversion, checking for correctness on small, handcrafted matrices.

- **Day 7: Dense GEMM Baseline**
  1.  **Goal:** Create a correct, simple reference implementation for matrix multiplication.
  2.  Implement a C++ function for a naive, triple-loop dense GEMM: `C = A * B`.
  3.  Expose this function to Python using your pybind11 setup.
  4.  Write a Python test that generates two random NumPy arrays, multiplies them with `np.dot`, and then calls your C++ GEMM.
  5.  Assert that the results are numerically very close (using `np.allclose`) to prove your baseline is correct. This is your ground truth.

- **Day 8: Sparse GEMM (SpMM) Implementation**
  1.  **Goal:** Implement the core sparse matrix multiplication kernel.
  2.  Write the C++ function for `SpMM(CSRMatrix A, DenseMatrix B) -> DenseMatrix C`. This is the core of Phase 1.
  3.  The outer loop iterates through rows of A. The inner loop iterates through non-zero elements of that row using `row_ptr` and `col_indices`.
  4.  Optimize the memory access pattern. Ensure you are reading from B in a cache-friendly way.
  5.  Expose this function to Python and write tests comparing its output against `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.dot(dense_matrix)`.

- **Day 9: Quantization Fundamentals**
  1.  **Goal:** Implement the basic building blocks for 8-bit integer quantization.
  2.  Implement a C++ function for asymmetric INT8 quantization: `quantize(float value, float scale, int8_t zero_point)`.
  3.  Implement the corresponding `dequantize` function.
  4.  Create a `calibrate` function that takes a vector of floats and determines the optimal `scale` and `zero_point` to minimize range loss.
  5.  Write unit tests for these functions, ensuring that `dequantize(quantize(x))` is close to `x`.

- **Day 10: Jinja2 Code Generation Setup**
  1.  **Goal:** Establish the templating pipeline for generating C++ code.
  2.  Install Jinja2 in your Python environment (`pip install jinja2`).
  3.  Create a `templates/` directory. Inside, create `gemm_kernel.h.j2`.
  4.  Write a simple C++ function signature in the template, like `void {{ function_name }}() {}`.
  5.  Write a Python script that loads this template, provides a value for `function_name` (e.g., "my_generated_gemm"), renders the template, and saves the output to a `.h` file. This validates the core generation loop.

### 🔹 **Phase 2: Code Generation & Conv2D (Days 11–20)**

- **Day 11: Templating the Dense GEMM Kernel**
  1.  **Goal:** Turn your working C++ GEMM code into a configurable template.
  2.  Copy your naive GEMM C++ code into the `gemm_kernel.h.j2` template.
  3.  Parameterize the function signature with data types (e.g., `{{ dtype }}* A`).
  4.  Parameterize the loop bounds using variables like `{{ M }}`, `{{ N }}`, `{{ K }}`.
  5.  Modify your Python generation script to pass these parameters to the template, generating a specific version of the GEMM kernel.

- **Day 12: Adding Tiling to the Template**
  1.  **Goal:** Implement the most important optimization for GEMM: cache blocking.
  2.  Modify the GEMM template to include loops for tiling. You will now have 6 nested loops.
  3.  Parameterize the tile sizes (e.g., `{{ TILE_M }}`, `{{ TILE_N }}`, `{{ TILE_K }}`).
  4.  The Python script now needs to take these tile sizes as input for generation.
  5.  Generate a tiled kernel and a non-tiled kernel and benchmark them to see the performance improvement from better cache usage.

- **Day 13: Templating the Sparse GEMM Kernel**
  1.  **Goal:** Apply the code generation strategy to your sparse kernel.
  2.  Create a new template, `spmm_kernel.h.j2`.
  3.  Copy your C++ SpMM code into this template.
  4.  Parameterize the data types and matrix dimensions.
  5.  The key challenge: think about what aspects of a sparse kernel *can* be templated. Often, it's less about tiling and more about data types or fusion opportunities.

- **Day 14: Conv2D via im2col**
  1.  **Goal:** Implement the `im2col` algorithm to transform a convolution into a matrix multiplication.
  2.  Write a C++ function `im2col(input_tensor, kernel_height, kernel_width, stride, padding)`.
  3.  This function will return a new, large matrix where each column represents a patch of the input that the kernel will slide over.
  4.  The `im2col` matrix dimensions will be `(kernel_h * kernel_w * in_channels, out_h * out_w)`.
  5.  Write extensive unit tests to verify the correctness of your `im2col` transformation.

- **Day 15: Conv2D Kernel Implementation**
  1.  **Goal:** Create a working Conv2D operator by combining `im2col` and `GEMM`.
  2.  The weights of the Conv layer must be reshaped into a matrix of `(out_channels, kernel_h * kernel_w * in_channels)`.
  3.  The Conv2D operation is now just `GEMM(reshaped_weights, im2col_matrix)`.
  4.  The result is a matrix that needs to be reshaped back to the output tensor format `(out_channels, out_h, out_w)`.
  5.  Test the entire flow against `torch.nn.Conv2d` for correctness.

- **Day 16: Templating the Conv2D Kernel**
  1.  **Goal:** Make the Conv2D operator code-generatable.
  2.  Create a `conv_kernel.h.j2` template.
  3.  This template will be a wrapper that calls the `im2col` function and then calls a **generated GEMM kernel**.
  4.  This demonstrates the power of your system: you can now generate an optimized Conv kernel by plugging in an optimized GEMM kernel.
  5.  The Python generator script should now support a "conv" operator type.

- **Day 17: Operator Fusion (Conv+ReLU)**
  1.  **Goal:** Implement your first fusion to improve performance by reducing memory access.
  2.  Create a new template `fused_conv_relu_kernel.h.j2`.
  3.  This template will be similar to the Conv template, but the GEMM it calls will have an extra step.
  4.  Modify the GEMM template to optionally include a final operation, like applying a ReLU (`output = max(0, output)`), before writing to memory.
  5.  This is a key "wow factor" moment: showing that your generator can create novel, fused operators.

- **Day 18: Auto-Tuning Framework**
  1.  **Goal:** Automate the process of finding the best kernel parameters (like tile sizes).
  2.  Write a Python script (`tuner.py`) that defines a search space for GEMM parameters (e.g., `TILE_M` in `[16, 32, 64]`).
  3.  The script will loop through all combinations, call your generator script to create the C++ kernel, and then call CMake/make to compile it.
  4.  It will then run a benchmark for that compiled kernel and record the performance.
  5.  After trying all combinations, it will output the JSON configuration for the fastest kernel found.

- **Day 19: CLI Refinement**
  1.  **Goal:** Make the toolchain's command-line interface more robust and user-friendly.
  2.  Use Python's `argparse` to create a proper CLI for your main generator script.
  3.  Add arguments to select the operator (`--op_type gemm`), set parameters (`--tile_m 32`), and specify the output file.
  4.  Add a `--tune` flag that invokes your new auto-tuner to find the best parameters automatically.
  5.  Implement a `--config` argument that can take the JSON output from the tuner to generate the optimal kernel.

- **Day 20: End-to-End Testing & Refactor**
  1.  **Goal:** Solidify the codebase and ensure all parts work together seamlessly.
  2.  Create an end-to-end test: Parse an ONNX model with a Conv layer -> Use the tuner to find the best Conv kernel params -> Generate the kernel -> Compile it -> Run it -> Check correctness.
  3.  Refactor the Python and C++ code into more modular classes (`KernelGenerator`, `Tuner`, `ONNXParser`).
  4.  Add performance regression tests to your CI pipeline to catch any changes that slow things down.
  5.  Run a memory checker like Valgrind or AddressSanitizer to find and fix any memory leaks.

### 🔹 **Phase 3: Quantization & AVX2 Optimization (Days 21–30)**

- **Day 21: Quantized GEMM Kernel**
  1.  **Goal:** Implement a GEMM kernel that operates on INT8 data.
  2.  The core of the kernel will multiply INT8 inputs, accumulating into INT32 registers to prevent overflow.
  3.  Implement the post-processing pipeline: take the INT32 accumulator, requantize it (scale it down), and add the bias.
  4.  This requantization step is critical and involves careful fixed-point arithmetic.
  5.  Create a new template `quantized_gemm.h.j2` for this logic.

- **Day 22: Quantized Conv2D Kernel**
  1.  **Goal:** Leverage the quantized GEMM to create a quantized Conv2D operator.
  2.  The flow is the same as the float version: `im2col` the INT8 input tensor.
  3.  The weights must also be quantized to INT8.
  4.  Call your new quantized GEMM kernel.
  5.  Validate the entire flow against a quantized model from a framework like PyTorch or TFLite.

- **Day 23: AVX2 Fundamentals**
  1.  **Goal:** Master the basic tools of SIMD programming for x86.
  2.  Read the Intel Intrinsics Guide. Focus on the `__m256` (float) and `__m256i` (integer) data types.
  3.  Learn the key operations: `_mm256_load_ps`, `_mm256_store_ps`, `_mm256_add_ps`, `_mm256_mul_ps`.
  4.  Write a simple C++ program that adds two arrays using a simple loop, and then again using AVX2 intrinsics.
  5.  Benchmark the two versions to see the raw power of vectorization. This is your "aha!" moment for SIMD.

- **Day 24: AVX2 GEMM Microkernel (Float)**
  1.  **Goal:** Build the core, highly-optimized building block for a fast GEMM.
  2.  Write a C++ function that computes a small, fixed-size outer product update, e.g., a 4x8 block, entirely using AVX2 registers.
  3.  This microkernel will be the innermost loop of your tiled GEMM.
  4.  Implement register blocking: keep blocks of A and B in AVX registers to maximize reuse.
  5.  Unroll loops within the microkernel to hide instruction latency and maximize throughput.

- **Day 25: Integrating the AVX2 Microkernel**
  1.  **Goal:** Build a full, fast GEMM kernel around your new microkernel.
  2.  Create a new template `avx2_gemm.h.j2`.
  3.  The outer loops will handle the tiling for the L1/L2 cache, just like before.
  4.  The inner loops are now replaced by a call to your AVX2 microkernel.
  5.  Benchmark your AVX2 GEMM against your naive tiled GEMM. The performance difference should be significant.

- **Day 26: AVX2 Quantized GEMM Microkernel**
  1.  **Goal:** Apply AVX2 optimizations to your INT8 GEMM. This is an advanced and highly valuable skill.
  2.  Study integer-specific AVX2 intrinsics, particularly `_mm256_madd_epi16` which is crucial for INT8 dot products.
  3.  The process involves loading INT8 data, converting it to INT16, performing the multiply-add, and accumulating into INT32 registers.
  4.  Write a microkernel for a quantized 8-bit GEMM block.
  5.  This is one of the most complex parts of the project. Take your time and test meticulously.

- **Day 27: Sparse AVX2 Implementation**
  1.  **Goal:** Attempt to vectorize the sparse matrix multiplication. This is very challenging.
  2.  The key opportunity is to vectorize the operations on the *dense* matrix (`B`).
  3.  When processing a non-zero element `A(i, j)`, you scale the `j`-th row of `B`. This scaling operation can be vectorized.
  4.  Use AVX2 gather instructions (`_mm256_i32gather_ps`) to load data from irregular locations, but profile them carefully as they can be slow.
  5.  Benchmark against your scalar SpMM. Even a small improvement is a win here, as this is a notoriously hard problem to vectorize.

- **Day 28: Software Prefetching**
  1.  **Goal:** Hide memory latency by telling the CPU what data you will need soon.
  2.  Learn the `_mm_prefetch` intrinsic.
  3.  In your tiled GEMM loops, add prefetch instructions for the next cache block of A and B you will need.
  4.  Tuning the distance and type of prefetch is an art. Experiment to find what works best.
  5.  This optimization provides a moderate but often "free" performance boost on memory-bound kernels.

- **Day 29: Runtime Dispatching**
  1.  **Goal:** Create a single binary that runs optimally on different CPUs.
  2.  Write a C++ function that uses the `__cpuid` instruction to detect if the host CPU supports AVX2.
  3.  Create a function pointer or a virtual class for your GEMM implementation.
  4.  At program startup, check for AVX2 support and set the function pointer to your `avx2_gemm` or `scalar_gemm` implementation.
  5.  This ensures your code is both fast on modern hardware and portable to older hardware.

- **Day 30: Final AVX Integration & Testing**
  1.  **Goal:** Ensure all your new, fast kernels are robust and correct.
  2.  Run your entire test suite for all generated kernels (scalar, AVX2, float, quantized).
  3.  Update your auto-tuner to be able to search over AVX2-specific parameters.
  4.  Update the generator CLI to allow selecting the target instruction set.
  5.  Celebrate! You've just completed the deepest, most technically challenging part of the project.

### 🔹 **Phase 4: Integration & Advanced Features (Days 31–40)**

- **Day 31: ONNXRuntime Execution Provider (EP) - Scaffolding**
  1.  **Goal:** Understand the ONNXRuntime API for creating a custom Execution Provider.
  2.  Read the ONNXRuntime documentation on creating EPs. Download the source and look at examples like the OpenVINO or TensorRT EPs.
  3.  Create a new C++ class `InferonExecutionProvider` that inherits from the required ORT base classes.
  4.  Implement the basic boilerplate: constructor, destructor, and the `GetCapability` method.
  5.  For now, `GetCapability` will tell ORT that your EP can handle `MatMul` and `Conv` nodes.

- **Day 32: ONNXRuntime EP - Kernel Registration**
  1.  **Goal:** Hook your generated kernels into the ONNXRuntime framework.
  2.  Implement the `Compile` method of the EP. This method is given a list of nodes that your EP is responsible for.
  3.  Inside `Compile`, you will create a "fused" kernel. For a single MatMul node, this is simple: just create an instance of your `MatMul` kernel class.
  4.  The `Compile` method should return a function that ORT will call to execute the kernel.
  5.  This is the core logic that connects the ONNX graph to your C++ code.

- **Day 33: ONNXRuntime EP - End-to-End**
  1.  **Goal:** Run a full model through ONNXRuntime using your custom EP.
  2.  Write a C++ example program that loads an ONNX model, creates an ORT session, and registers your `InferonExecutionProvider`.
  3.  Run inference. When ORT encounters a MatMul or Conv op, it should now call your EP and execute your generated kernel.
  4.  Verify the outputs are correct.
  5.  Benchmark the performance against the default CPU EP (MLAS) to prove your work is paying off.

- **Day 34: PyTorch Custom Operator - Scaffolding**
  1.  **Goal:** Create a Python class that makes your C++ kernels look and feel like a native PyTorch layer.
  2.  Read the PyTorch documentation on creating C++ extensions.
  3.  Create a new Python class that inherits from `torch.autograd.Function`.
  4.  Define the `forward` and `backward` static methods. For inference, the `backward` pass can be minimal.
  5.  The `forward` method is where you will call your C++ kernel.

- **Day 35: PyTorch Custom Operator - Integration**
  1.  **Goal:** Bridge the gap between PyTorch tensors and your C++ code.
  2.  In the `forward` method, get the data pointers from the input PyTorch tensors.
  3.  Use your pybind11 bindings to pass these pointers to your C++ kernel functions.
  4.  The C++ function will write its result to an output tensor that you allocate.
  5.  Wrap this output data pointer back into a PyTorch tensor and return it.

- **Day 36: PyTorch Model Surgery**
  1.  **Goal:** Seamlessly replace layers in an existing PyTorch model with your custom, high-performance versions.
  2.  Write a Python function `replace_layers(model)`.
  3.  This function will iterate through all modules in the model.
  4.  If it finds a module of type `torch.nn.Linear` or `torch.nn.Conv2d`, it will replace it with an instance of your custom operator class.
  5.  Load a pretrained model (e.g., from `torchvision`), run the surgery, and verify that the model still produces correct outputs.

- **Day 37: Multi-Threading with OpenMP**
  1.  **Goal:** Use a simple, powerful tool to parallelize your kernels across multiple CPU cores.
  2.  Add the `OpenMP::OpenMP_CXX` target to your CMake build.
  3.  In your tiled GEMM/Conv kernels, add an `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to the outermost loop (e.g., the loop over the batch dimension or output rows).
  4.  Experiment with different loop collapse and scheduling strategies.
  5.  Benchmark the performance scaling as you increase the number of threads. You should see a near-linear speedup on multi-core systems.

- **Day 38: Structured Sparsity (2:4 Pattern)**
  1.  **Goal:** Implement a specific, high-impact sparsity pattern used in modern hardware.
  2.  The 2:4 pattern means that in every block of 4 elements, at least 2 must be zero.
  3.  Write a new sparse format or a specialized CSR encoder to handle this pattern.
  4.  Create a specialized AVX2 kernel that can efficiently load and process these 2:4 sparse blocks. This is a significant optimization opportunity.
  5.  This demonstrates you are up-to-date with modern sparsity techniques beyond simple random sparsity.

- **Day 39: Advanced Fusion (Conv+Bias+ReLU)**
  1.  **Goal:** Implement a more complex and highly beneficial fusion pattern.
  2.  Your ONNX parser needs a graph pass that can detect the specific pattern: a `Conv` node, followed by an `Add` (for the bias), followed by a `ReLU`.
  3.  When this pattern is detected, your `KernelEmitter` should select a new, specialized template: `fused_conv_bias_relu.h.j2`.
  4.  This template will contain a kernel that performs all three operations in one pass, saving significant memory bandwidth.
  5.  Benchmark this fused kernel to show the performance gain over executing the three operators sequentially.

- **Day 40: Review and Refactor**
  1.  **Goal:** Consolidate the significant progress from the last 10 days.
  2.  Review the EP and PyTorch integration code. Clean up the interfaces and add comments.
  3.  Ensure all new features (multi-threading, structured sparsity, fusion) are covered by tests.
  4.  Update the documentation to reflect these new, advanced capabilities.
  5.  Take a moment to appreciate the system you've built: it can now accelerate models in two major frameworks.

### 🔹 **Phase 5: Benchmarking, Polish & Documentation (Days 41–50)**

- **Day 41: Benchmarking Framework**
  1.  **Goal:** Build a reliable and scientific way to measure your project's performance.
  2.  Create a Python-based benchmarking script.
  3.  The script should run each kernel multiple times to get stable timings and calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation.
  4.  Include a "warm-up" phase of several runs that are not timed to allow the CPU to reach a stable clock frequency.
  5.  The script should be able to output results in a structured format like JSON or CSV for easy plotting.

- **Day 42: End-to-End Model Benchmarking**
  1.  **Goal:** Prove your tool's value on real, complete neural network models.
  2.  Choose 2-3 well-known models, like ResNet-18 or MobileNetV2.
  3.  Run inference on these models using three configurations: baseline PyTorch/ORT, your engine with scalar kernels, and your engine with AVX2 kernels.
  4.  Measure the end-to-end latency for each configuration.
  5.  This is the ultimate test and will provide the headline numbers for your project's success.

- **Day 43: Performance Visualization**
  1.  **Goal:** Communicate your benchmark results in a clear, compelling way.
  2.  Use a Python library like `matplotlib` or `seaborn` to plot your benchmark results.
  3.  Create bar charts comparing your engine's latency to the baselines for each model.
  4.  Create a speedup chart (e.g., "Inferon is 2.5x faster than ONNXRuntime") which is a very powerful visual.
  5.  Add these plots to your `README.md`.

- **Day 44: Roofline Analysis**
  1.  **Goal:** Understand the theoretical limits of your kernels.
  2.  Research the Roofline Model. It helps you understand if your kernel is limited by the CPU's computational power (compute-bound) or by memory bandwidth (memory-bound).
  3.  Measure your kernel's arithmetic intensity (ops/byte) and performance (GFLOPs/s).
  4.  Plot this on a chart with the theoretical peak performance and memory bandwidth of your CPU.
  5.  This advanced analysis shows a deep understanding of hardware performance.

- **Day 45: Error Handling & Robustness**
  1.  **Goal:** Make your tool robust and easy to debug for other users.
  2.  Go through your C++ and Python code and add comprehensive error checking. Check for null pointers, invalid input dimensions, file-not-found, etc.
  3.  Use exceptions or error codes consistently.
  4.  Add a verbose logging option to your CLI that prints detailed information about the generation process.
  5.  Create a debugging mode that dumps the intermediate outputs of fused kernels to help diagnose numerical issues.

- **Day 46: README & Build Instructions**
  1.  **Goal:** Write the most important piece of documentation for your project.
  2.  Structure your `README.md` clearly: Project Goal, Features, Performance Highlights, Build Instructions, Usage Examples.
  3.  Write clear, step-by-step build instructions for a new user on Linux and Windows.
  4.  Include code snippets showing how to use your CLI to generate a kernel and how to use the PyTorch operator.
  5.  Add the compelling benchmark plots you created earlier.

- **Day 47: API Documentation**
  1.  **Goal:** Document your code's public interfaces for other developers.
  2.  Set up Doxygen for your C++ code. Add Doxygen-style comments (`/** ... */`) to your public classes and methods in the header files.
  3.  Set up Sphinx for your Python code. Configure it to auto-generate documentation from your Python docstrings.
  4.  Write a short tutorial page in your documentation that walks a user through a complete example.
  5.  Host the generated documentation on GitHub Pages for a professional look.

- **Day 48: Final Code Polish**

- **Day 49: Presentation & Demo**
  1.  **Goal:** Prepare to present your work to others.
  2.  Create a short slide deck summarizing the project: The Problem, Your Solution, The Architecture, Key Features (Sparsity, Quantization, AVX2, Fusion), and Benchmark Results.
  3.  Record a short (2-3 minute) video demonstrating the tool. Show the code generation, the model surgery, and the final speedup.
  4.  Practice your presentation. Be ready to explain the technical details and the impact of your work.

- **Day 50: Future Work & Celebration**
  1.  **Goal:** Finalize the project and identify next steps.
  2.  In your `README.md`, create a "Future Work" section.
  3.  List potential extensions, such as supporting more operators, adding ARM NEON support, or exploring more advanced fusion techniques.
  4.  This shows foresight and a deep understanding of the problem space.
  5.  Clean up your workspace, push all final changes, and celebrate the completion of an incredibly impressive and practical project!
